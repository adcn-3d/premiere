# Open Source Premiere Pro CC and After Effects CC Plugins!
This journey is going to be amazing! 
ALL OF THE PLUGINS ARE COMPATIBLE WITH BOTH, PREMIERE PRO AND AFTER EFFECTS!

The first plugin I created is the Focus Peaking plugin who's job is to mimic the focus peaking function on Sony mirrorless cameras.

For more information on how to set-up your computer and how to build the plugins, visit my blog: [nikov-exploring.blogspot.com](http://nikov-exploring.blogspot.com)

In every different plugin folder, you can find a sub-folder which is the open source project and already built version of the latest plugin.
You can modify any of the plugins as long as you gave me attribution.
